Grant:
There were ten people in the international space station. Two of those ten
snuck on the ship and are aliens, imitating the way us humans act in order to gain intelligence.
The aliens act as if they are doing their own jobs but instead are slowly trying to kill the humans
so that they can gain control of the space station. While Jim, one of the humans, is carrying out his tasks one day,
he stumbles upon a body that is cut in half! In panic, he calls a meeting to discuss what happenend. 

Mohnish:
The lights start to flicker until they are at full brightness.
"Who decided to chop off Blue's head?", one of the crew asks.
Jim approaches the table and asks if they know where the Green crewmate has been.
A long silence commences, until it is broken by Brown exclaiming that he saw Green going towards the electrical room.
Naturally, the crew came to a consensus: Green was forced into an airlock and booted from the ship.

Owen:
After completing tasks and discovering two more bodies, the crew held two more meetings. They booted
another member from the ship, but this did not solve their problem. The humans knew, that without knowing who
the aliens were, their only chance was to stick together. They stayed in a group, where the alien couldn't attack one without
blowing his cover. Eventually, the humans completed their tasks, and the space station was saved. In frustration,
the alien gave up his cover. The humans had bested him, and he couldn't defeat them all alone. Or was he alone?
