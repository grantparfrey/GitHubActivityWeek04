There were ten people in the international space station. Two of those ten
snuck on the ship and are aliens, imitating the way us humans act in order to gain intelligence.
The aliens act as if they are doing their own jobs but instead are slowly trying to kill the humans
so that they can gain control of the space station. While Jim, one of the humans, is carrying out his tasks one day,
he stumbles upon a body that is cut in half! In panic, he calls a meeting to discuss what happenend.
